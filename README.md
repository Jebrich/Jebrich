## Hello! 👋

My name is Oscar, and I'm a student learning to code. Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm thrilled that you're here to learn more about me and my programming journey.


## About Me

I'm currently studying software engineering at [42Rome](https://github.com/42roma). Before this, I had a diverse range of experiences, from owning a restaurant to working in retail and customer service. These experiences taught me a lot about teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability.

Even though I'm just getting started with coding, I've always been interested in technology and building things. I love learning how systems work and discovering ways to leverage technology to improve people's lives. My goal is to develop innovative solutions to important problems.

Outside of programming, I enjoy activities like cycling, hiking, traveling, and photography. Experiencing new cultures and connecting with people from all walks of life inspires me. I try to nurture an optimistic growth mindset in all areas of life. There's always an opportunity to expand your mind and improve your skills!

## Skills and Tools

I'm still learning, but here are some of the skills and tools I'm familiar with:

- Languages: 
  - Python 🐍 (1/5)
  - HTML 🌐 (3/5)
  - CSS 🎨 (2/5)
  - C 🖥️ (3/5)
  - JAVA ☕ (1/5)
  
- Version Control: Git 🗄️
- OS: Linux 🐧, Macintosh 🍎
- Tools: VS Code 💻, Notion 📝, vim ✍️

## What I'm Learning

Right now, I'm focused on the cursus of 42 Network. We are diving deep into various topics such as C language, BASH, data structures, algorithms, web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), networking (TCP/IP, network protocols), system administration (Linux-based operating systems), and software engineering methodologies. My goal is to learn system and kernel development, with the hope of contributing to open-source projects like Linux distributions or developing open and free operating systems for mobile devices. In the future, I'm also eager to explore Rust.

I'd love to connect with other developers and mentors in these areas. There's so much to learn, and guidance from more experienced programmers would be invaluable.
